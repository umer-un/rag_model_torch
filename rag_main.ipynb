Around the world, approximately 40 percent of infants  are breastfed exclusively for the recommended 6 months.121314  New mothers must also pay careful consideration to their own  nutritional requirements to help their bodies recover in the wake of  the pregnancy. This is particularly true for women who breastfeed  their babies, which increases the need in certain nutrients.  Lactation  Preparation for making breast milk, although begun in puberty, is  not completed until a woman’s first pregnancy. Early in the first  trimester, the cells that will secrete milk divide and multiply.  Hormones play a major role in preparing the woman’s body to  breastfeed, particularly during the second and third trimesters. At  that point, levels of the hormone prolactin increase to stimulate the  growth of the milk duct system, which initiates and maintains milk  production. Also during pregnancy, progesterone stimulates growth  of the alveoli, the clusters of cells where the milk is made. During  this process ducts that will carry the milk grow larger and branch  out, and new capillaries are also formed to circulate the increased  blood supply. However, levels of the hormone progesterone need  to decrease for successful milk production, because progesterone  12.\\xa0UNICEF Data. (2019, October).

Protein Input = Protein Used by the Body + Protein Excreted  The appropriate amount of protein in a person’s diet is that which  maintains a balance between what is taken in and what is used. The  RDAs for protein were determined by assessing nitrogen balance.  Nitrogen is one of the four basic elements contained in all amino  acids. When proteins are broken down and amino acids are  catabolized, nitrogen is released. Remember that when the liver  breaks down amino acids, it produces ammonia, which is rapidly  converted to nontoxic, nitrogen-containing urea, which is then  transported to the kidneys for excretion. Most nitrogen is lost as  urea in the urine, but urea is also excreted in the feces. Proteins are  also lost in sweat and as hair and nails grow. The RDA, therefore,  is the amount of protein a person should consume in their diet to  balance the amount of protein used up and lost from the body. For  healthy adults, this amount of protein was determined to be 0.8  grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. You can calculate  410  |  Proteins, Diet, and Personal Choices',\n",
