So, nutrient-dense  foods, which are higher in proportion of macronutrients and  micronutrients relative to calories, are essential to a healthy diet.  Examples of nutrient-dense foods include fruits, vegetables, whole  grains, peas, beans, eggs, reduced-fat dairy, and lean meats.  Pregnant women should be able to meet almost all of their increased  needs via a healthy diet. However, expectant mothers should take a  prenatal supplement to ensure an adequate intake of iron and folate.  Here are some additional dietary guidelines for pregnant women.6:  • Eat iron-rich or iron-fortified foods, including meat or meat  alternatives, breads, and cereals, to help satisfy increased need  for iron and prevent iron-deficiency anemia.  • Include vitamin C-rich foods, such as orange juice, broccoli, or  strawberries, to enhance iron absorption.  • Eat a well-balanced diet, including fruits, vegetables, whole  grains, calcium-rich foods, lean meats, and a variety of cooked  seafood (excluding fish that are high in mercury, such as  swordfish and shark).  • Drink additional fluids, water especially.  6.\\xa0Staying Healthy and Safe.
