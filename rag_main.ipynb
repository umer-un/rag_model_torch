The World Health  Organization defines probiotics as live bacteria that confer  beneficial health effects on their host. They are sometimes  called “friendly bacteria.” The most common bacteria  labeled as probiotic is lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli). They  are added as live cultures to certain fermented foods such  as yogurt. Prebiotics are indigestible foods, primarily  soluble fibers, that stimulate the growth of certain strains  of bacteria in the large intestine and provide health benefits  to the host.

Figure 8.2 Superoxide  A molecule with one unpaired electron, which makes it a free  radical.  The reactivity of free radicals is what poses a threat to  macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and fatty acids. Free  radicals can cause chain reactions that ultimately damage cells.  For example, a superoxide molecule may react with a fatty acid  and steal one of its electrons. The fatty acid then becomes a free  radical that can react with another fatty acid nearby. As this chain  reaction continues, the permeability and fluidity of cell membranes  changes, proteins in cell membranes experience decreased activity,  and receptor proteins undergo changes in structure that either alter  or stop their function. If receptor proteins designed to react to  insulin levels undergo a structural change it can negatively affect  glucose uptake.
